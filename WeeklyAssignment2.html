<h2>HTML and Bootstrap <span class="badge badge-secondary">So New It Will Melt Your Face</span></h2>

We will get to this starting in Week 4, but you can also put raw HTML codeblocks into Markdown and have Jupyter render them.

Some cool examples using [Bootstrap `div` classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/alerts/) (Week 10!) from the Satopay article:

```<div class="alert alert-block alert-info"><b>Tip:</b> Use blue boxes (alert-info) for tips and notes.</div>```

<div class="alert alert-block alert-info"><b>Tip:</b> Use blue boxes (alert-info) for tips and notes.</div>
