                <h1>Breaking Bad Viewing Analysis</h1>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;The show <i>Breaking Bad</i> has been popularized since its captivating season finale release.
                     The relatability of the characters and the inclusion of platforms like Netflix, allowed this television 
                     show to become cemented in foundational media history. <i>Breaking Bad</i> became one of most talked about 
                     shows primarily because of its circumstantial place in time. During its airing, streaming services began to 
                     become more popularized and mainstream. Gaining viewers at rates unseen since the creation of the television 
                     and radio. This analysis will quantitatively show how a streaming service like Netflix can exponentially increase 
                     the amount of people that watch a particular show, in this case, <i>Breaking Bad</i>.
                    </p>
                <h2>Analysis</h2>
                    <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;To obtain a better understanding of how well Netflix boosted <i>Breaking Bad</i>’s viewership, I had to find
                     a dataset pertaining to what I needed. One interesting dataset I ended up utilizing was from
                     <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/twintyone/breaking-bad-ratings">Kaggle</a>
                     This dataset is in CSV format, and is an aggregated source for us-viewer numbers per episode, as well as particular
                     rating and voting data. Initially, I created several visualizations to help me understand what the data was attempting
                     to show. I ended up using Altair formatting to create this first 
                     <a href="https://cosaari.github.io/bbVotes.html" target="_blank">graph</a>
                     that shows the number of votes from a movie rating site per episode. This shows a very basic understanding of how 
                     exponentially increasing the number of votes for each episode is. Beyond, recognizing this initial trend, I wanted
                     to see how this smaller group of avid movie watchers related to the general US population watching. This next 
                     <a href="https://cosaari.github.io/bbViews.html" target="_blank">graph</a>
                     shows the exponential growth in the number of US viewers per episode of <i>Breaking Bad</i>. Again, this increase
                     can be clearly seen with the increase in episodes. As Netflix continually began to advertise and allow people to
                     easily stream the show, its following and popularity grew. Statistically speaking this can be seen as well. One 
                     interesting comparison that I made in the notebook for this analysis was the percentage increases in the total 
                     number of votes and US views per season. Below you can see how the final season showed amazing advances in the 
                     total number of people that watched it and decided to vote for it.

                <h2>Research</h2>
                    <p></p>
                     &emsp;&emsp;Beyond recognition of this quantitative increase in viewership through statistical analysis, 
                     many articles and sources have also seen this magnification effect by Netflix. One article from 
                     <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/7/14/21312595/netflix-breaking-bad-podcast-streaming-land-of-the-giants">Vox</a>
                     in particular saw this trend and fittingly named it the “Netflix Effect”. Or as they put it,
                     “Netflix’s ability to find new and bigger audiences for shows”. Some reasons for this effect
                     is that streaming services allow for particular characteristics that viewers inherently look for.
                     Such as limited viewing of advertisements, continual streaming of multiple episodes, and ease of access. One 
                     <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2013/09/30/why-and-how-the-breaking-bad-finale-broke-records.html"><i>CNBC</i></a>
                     article, also pointed out the shear magnitude of this increase in viewership by stating “it has the third
                     most watched series finale in cable history, behind only HBO’s <i>“The Sopranos”</i> and <i>“Sex & the City”</i>.
                     The creator of the show Vince Gilligan even shared at the Golden Globes how “Netflix saved <i>Breaking Bad</i>”.
                     Prior to the real advent of multiple streaming services, Netflix had a majority control of the market and this
                     allowed for network shows and Netflix original shows hosted on Netflix to have a lot of users watching at one
                     time. However, as time has gone on there are now many more services that are moving towards streaming, and with
                     the recent pandemic many have been changing the way they watch TV. According to
                     <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2020/03/31/coronavirus-nielsen-tallies-big-jump-streaming-among-shut-ins/5094586002/"><i>USA Today</i></a>
                     , “Netflix and Hulu claimed a smaller share of viewing than they did last year...Netflix claimed 29% of total
                     streaming minutes...down from 36% the previous year”. The more viewers move away from Netflix, the more other
                     streaming platforms begin to grow, for example, “Youtube represented 20% up from 19%, Amazon inched up to 9%
                     from 7%, and other services like Disney Plus and Apple TV jumped to 31% from 23%”. Even though this market
                     has become saturated with competing organizations, the overall trend towards streaming as the primary source
                     of televised entertainment is apparent. 
                    </p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                     &emsp;&emsp;The television show <i>Breaking Bad</i> is a fundamental example of the role streaming platforms have played in
                     popularizing television. Not only did the advent of Netflix boost this shows viewers to historic levels, but
                     streaming as a whole realized the evolving expectations of the general user. As more and more media has moved to
                     online platforms, niche markets for larger genres such as news, television, radio, and music will be created and
                     expanded at exponential rates. The real question is whether you can recognize this shift or trend, and create a product
                     that fits with this general transition to better information sharing and consuming.
