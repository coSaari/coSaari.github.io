                <h1>Breaking Bad Design Workflow</h1>
                <h2>Precondition</h2>
                <center><i><h3>Learning</h3></i></center>
                <center><p><ul><li>&emsp;&emsp;The show <i>Breaking Bad</i> has been popularized since its captivating season finale release.
                    The relatability of the characters and the inclusion of platforms like Netflix, allowed this television 
                    show to become cemented in foundational media history. <i>Breaking Bad</i> became one of most talked about 
                    shows primarily because of its circumstantial place in time. During its airing, streaming services began to 
                    become more popularized and mainstream. Gaining viewers at rates unseen since the creation of the television 
                    and radio. The primary problem I plan to focus on in this design workflow is how the viewership of <i>Breaking Bad</i>
                    increased over its lifetime to explain the inclusion of online streaming services. This problem is crucial in understand 
                    how exponentially increasing viewing numbers can be achieved as the result of a new innovative medium.</li></ul></p></center>

                    <center><p><ul><li>
                    &emsp;&emsp;To obtain a better understanding of how well Netflix boosted <i>Breaking Bad</i>’s viewership, I had to find
                     a dataset pertaining to what I needed. One interesting dataset I ended up utilizing was from
                     <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/twintyone/breaking-bad-ratings">Kaggle</a>
                     This dataset is in CSV format, and is an filtered source for us-viewer numbers per episode, as well as particular
                     ratings and voting data. This specific Kaggle dataset utilizes two seperate datasets to obtain its information.
                     The first coming from <a href="https://www.ratingraph.com/tv-shows/breaking-bad-ratings-26165/" target="_blank">Rating Graph</a>. 
                     This website is used to as an online visualization tool that has since collected millions of user ratings on a variety of 
                     shows and movies. However, this was simply created as a "one-man hobby project", and "is not meant to be scientifically accurate or reliable". 
                     Given that it is simply a personal project with no scientific basis, leads to questionable biases within the data. Yet, it
                     still holds interesting third-party data that is easily connected to the more fundamental features. For example, the second dataset can be found at
                     <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_Breaking_Bad_episodes" target="_blank">Wikiwand</a>. This dataset includes reliable us-viewer numbers pertaining 
                     to the <i>Breaking Bad</i> series. This dataset also includes interesting metadata included in the kaggle dataset, such as air date, season / episode number.
                     Granted there is little information regarding how the us-viewer numbers were aggregated and if it includes multiple sources of viewers.
                     <b>For consistency, particular episodes in season two had to be dropped because of NULL values in certain feature characteristics</b>

                <ul>
                    <li>This basic iteration of the first task shows the comparison between the number of episodes
                        and the total US viewers watching per episode. One major design choice was the implementation
                        of a categorical color scheme. This will allow the user to clearly distinguish between each season.
                        A vertical bar chart was also utilized in order to better frame the increase in viewership.

                        This first task visualization shows the relationship between the number of episodes
                        per season of Breaking Bad and the total number of US viewers. Some particular observations 
                        that were of interest was the inconsistent exponential increase in the number of votes and
                        the number of views per episode. One would expect that the highest voted episode was the season 
                        finale, but in reality it was the second to last episode that was voted for the most.

                        This second task visualization shows the relationships of votes and ratings against the number 
                        of episodes. One observation that was very apparent was the little deviation amongst the particular ratings 
                        per episode. There is a slight increase as the seasons increase, but this can most likely be explained by the increase 
                        in general viewers as the show became more popular. However, the number of votes per episode also correlates well
                        with the number of US viewers per episode above.

                    differentiation between specific feature characteristcs outlines clear patterns and trends that need to be seen.
                    Utilizing categorical color schemes allowed for very neat clarity and visual appeal. As well, the inclusion of a more detailed
                    tool-tip or interactive elements allowed me personally to understand more about the information I was seeing than just the simple
                    plot could not.

                     &emsp;&emsp;Beyond recognition of this quantitative increase in viewership through statistical analysis, 
                     many articles and sources have also seen this magnification effect by Netflix. One article from 
                     <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/7/14/21312595/netflix-breaking-bad-podcast-streaming-land-of-the-giants">Vox</a>
                     in particular saw this trend and fittingly named it the “Netflix Effect”. Or as they put it,
                     “Netflix’s ability to find new and bigger audiences for shows”. Some reasons for this effect
                     is that streaming services allow for particular characteristics that viewers inherently look for.
                     Such as limited viewing of advertisements, continual streaming of multiple episodes, and ease of access. One 
                     <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2013/09/30/why-and-how-the-breaking-bad-finale-broke-records.html"><i>CNBC</i></a>
                     article, also pointed out the shear magnitude of this increase in viewership by stating “it has the third
                     most watched series finale in cable history, behind only HBO’s <i>“The Sopranos”</i> and <i>“Sex & the City”</i>.
                     The creator of the show Vince Gilligan even shared at the Golden Globes how “Netflix saved <i>Breaking Bad</i>”.
                     Prior to the real advent of multiple streaming services, Netflix had a majority control of the market and this
                     allowed for network shows and Netflix original shows hosted on Netflix to have a lot of users watching at one
                     time. However, as time has gone on there are now many more services that are moving towards streaming, and with
                     the recent pandemic many have been changing the way they watch TV. According to
                     <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2020/03/31/coronavirus-nielsen-tallies-big-jump-streaming-among-shut-ins/5094586002/"><i>USA Today</i></a>
                     , “Netflix and Hulu claimed a smaller share of viewing than they did last year...Netflix claimed 29% of total
                     streaming minutes...down from 36% the previous year”. The more viewers move away from Netflix, the more other
                     streaming platforms begin to grow, for example, “Youtube represented 20% up from 19%, Amazon inched up to 9%
                     from 7%, and other services like Disney Plus and Apple TV jumped to 31% from 23%”. Even though this market
                     has become saturated with competing organizations, the overall trend towards streaming as the primary source
                     of televised entertainment is apparent.
