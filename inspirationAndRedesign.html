                    <p style="font-family: 'monospace', monospace;">
                     &emsp;&emsp; Unfourtunately, for some context, I did not save my previous portfolio website 
                     created initially with HTML and CSS. After completely updating my website with inline visualizations
                     and bootstrap functionality, I realized that I had not kept an original version. So this site serves as 
                     an explanatory section describing the changes to my site and its inspiration.
                     <br>
                     <a class="btn btn-outline-dark" href="https://cosaari.github.io/HomePage.html">HomePage</a>
                     <br>
                     &emsp;&emsp; The homepage linked above, and in the nav section, show the starting page of my portfolio.
                     The site you are currently on is a general skeleton of what my portfolio pages are constructed on.
                     As you may notice, there are the inclusion of special buttons that bootstrap offers, particularly the one seen above.
                     These buttons were utilized to mesh with the theme of the overall site. This is because I personally
                     felt the black fill of the button while hovering over it meshed well with the color scheme, as well as 
                     certain interactivity on the other pages. It also looks much cleaner than the previous html links. This 
                     updated navigation was the major design update amongst all the pages. I went for a simple approach to my design so 
                     less is more in some instances. 
                     <br>
                     <a class="btn btn-outline-dark" href="https://cosaari.github.io/AboutMe.html">About Me</a>
                     <br>
                     &emsp;&emsp; The about me page's major changes include the continual changes to the general fonts and minor 
                     formatting updates. Beyond this, the major update is the navigation section which utilizes the bootstrap functionality.
                     <br>
                     <a class="btn btn-outline-dark" href="https://cosaari.github.io/Portfolio.html">Portfolio</a>
                     <br>
                     &emsp;&emsp; The portfolio page took up the majority of my time for this project because of the visualization section.
                     These altair visualizations are displayed on the page and are interactive with the user's mouse. You can also download the visualizations
                     on the page as a PNG, JPG, or other formats. Beyond this additional buttons were utilized in order to link to specific projects.
                     I used the same buttons in order to have a simple and continual theme across the website.
                     <br>
                     <a class="btn btn-outline-dark" href="https://cosaari.github.io/Contact.html">Contact</a>
                     <br>
                     &emsp;&emsp; The contact page is where an additional bootstrap attribute was utilized beyond the use of the navigation bar.
                     I needed a structure that allowed me to list my contact information to my users. To do this I played with a lot of differing
                     accordian sections, and other objects to try and display the information. I ended up finding a simplistic looking list 
                     object that fits nicely into my page, and simply displays my info. 
                    </p>

                <h3 style="color:Gray; font-family: 'DejaVu Sans Mono', monospace;"><b>Inspiration</b></h3>
                <a class="btn btn-outline-dark" href="https://harrisonjansma.com/archive">Harrison Jansma</a>
                    <p style="font-family: 'monospace', monospace;">
                     &emsp;&emsp; I used Harrison Jansma's portfolio as inspiration because his site has a very unique 
                     look that gets straight to the point. I attempted to simulate Mr. Jansma's simplistic approach in my website 
                     to attempt to give my viewers easy access to my information, and access to my work or projects. His
                     utilization of buttons and links to projects was very easy to use, this can be seen in the similar navigational
                     areas and links to other works.
                    </p>

                <a class="btn btn-outline-dark" href="https://www.yan-holtz.com/">Yan Holtz</a>
                    <p style="font-family: 'monospace', monospace;">
                     &emsp;&emsp; Yan Holt's website was another very interesting portrayal of a simplistic and cool site.
                     I really enjoyed the interactivity of his site and the moving components. This was emulated in my site
                     with gifs because that was the closest I could get to a nice moving background, as well as
                     the inclusion of interactive altair visualizations on the portfolio page.
